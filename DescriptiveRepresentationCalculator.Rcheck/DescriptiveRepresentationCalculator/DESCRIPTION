Description: A system for analyzing descriptive representation, especially for comparing the composition of a political body to the population it represents. Users can compute the expected degree of representation for a body under a random sampling model, the expected degree of representation variability, as well as representation scores from observed political bodies. The package is based on Gerring, Jerzak, and Oncel (2023) <doi:10.1017/S0003055423000680>.
