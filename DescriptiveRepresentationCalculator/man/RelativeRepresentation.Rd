\title{Compute relative representation compared to random sampling}
\usage{
RelativeRepresentation(BodyMemberCharacteristics, PopShares,
  a = -0.5, b = 1, standardize = FALSE, nMonte = 10000)
}
\arguments{
\item{BodyMemberCharacteristics}{A vector specifying characteristics for each member of a political body.}

\item{PopShares}{A numeric vector of population group proportions. Names must correspond to identities in \code{BodyMemberCharacteristics}.}

\item{a, b}{Parameters controlling the affine transformation of the representation index.}

\item{standardize}{Logical. If \code{TRUE}, the difference between observed and expected representation is divided by the standard deviation under random sampling.}

\item{nMonte}{Positive integer giving the number of Monte Carlo iterations used when \code{standardize = TRUE}.}
}
\value{
A scalar difference between observed and expected representation. When \code{standardize = TRUE} this difference is divided by the standard deviation under the random sampling model.
}
\description{
Calculates the difference between observed and expected representation. Optionally standardizes this difference using the standard deviation of representation under the random sampling model.
