# Introduction
How much representation should we expected in a given political body, given the composition of the population and the size of that body? 

**Expected Representation:** This package provides one function, `ExpectedRepresentation`, that calculates the degree of representation under random sampling, where representation is calculated using the Rose Index of Proportionality. 

**Characterizing Unexplained Representation:** It contains another function `ResidualRepresentation`, that calculates the degree of representation we would expect not to be explained by the average discrepancy value; this quantity is the variance of the Rose Index of Proportionality under the random sampling model.
